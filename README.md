Contact: Prof. Mark Sherman @marksherman

# 1101 Introduction to Programming
Platform: [Codio](https://www.codio.com/)

# 2201 Data Analytics
Platform: [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)

# 2132 Practical Machine Learning
Platform: [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)

Tools: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

Most assignments are done through existing web sites, and the assignment simply requires editing a README.md and adding images. These assignments do not require the Docker component, as the student does not build or run code. 

# Programming II & Introduction to Computer Science
Platform: [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/)

* For Github Classroom, create a Github organization per course. Re-use the organization in successive offerings of the course. This allows assignments to be easily replicated.
